## 🚧 Future Implementations

Here are some ideas and plans for expanding TuneFlow in the future:

| Feature                        | Status        | Notes                                                                                       |
|------------------------------- |--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ▶️ YouTube Playlist Creation   | ✅ Done       | Create regular YouTube playlists directly from parsed tracks. (YouTube Music not supported.) **Note: I need to get the app approved for public use on Google OAuth.** |
| 🌗 Day/Night Toggle             | ✅ Done       | Implement a seamless toggle between light and dark modes, allowing users to switch themes for optimal comfort and accessibility at any time. |
| 📱 Optimize for Mobile Layouts | 🚧 In Progress | Enhance TuneFlow's UI and user experience for mobile devices. This includes responsive layouts, touch-friendly controls, and streamlined navigation—so you can create and manage playlists seamlessly on any screen, anywhere! |
| 🍏 Apple Music API             | 🕒 Planned    | Explore adding Apple Music integration for broader playlist export options.                 |
| 🧠 Advanced Song Detection     | 🕒 Planned    | Detect songs in videos even without tracklists in description/comments using AI/audio.      |
| 🎼 YT Music Connection         | 🕒 Planned    | Explore connecting to YouTube Music for playlist creation if supported by YouTube.          |
| 🎧 SoundCloud API Integration  | ⏸️ Paused     | Backend implemented, but feature is paused until API keys/support resume after May 2.       |
